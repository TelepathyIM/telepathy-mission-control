telepathy-mission-control 5.1.0 (UNRELEASED)
============================================

The "beta 75 would have been silly" release.

After months of development, this is the first numbered release of Mission
Control 5. We jumped straight to 5.1 in order to use the Linux-style odd/even
versioning seen in the other Telepathy components, so the 5.1.x development
branch will lead to the 5.2.x stable branch.

Changes since Mission Control 4 are too numerous to list here, but here are
the major architectural changes.

The proprietary MissionControl API no longer exists; the daemon is a
telepathy-spec-compliant AccountManager, and also a telepathy-spec-compliant
ChannelDispatcher. Consequences of this include:

* Clients are no longer expected to implement the ChannelHandler interface.
  Instead, they may implement the Observer, Approver and/or Handler interfaces
  specified in telepathy-spec.

* The design of channel dispatching copes better with having multiple user
  interface components installed.

* Accounts' presence, avatar and nickname are now independent (stored
  per-account), allowing for more precise control by UIs.

* Accounts no longer have to belong to a "profile", although they still can
  (albeit only by using a non-standard extension).

Accounts are now stored in a flat file, rather than by abusing GConf. The
included mc-account-convert tool might be able to convert MC 4 accounts to
the MC 5 format, if you're lucky.

libmissioncontrol-server has changed its API and ABI considerably, and is not
yet considered stable in its new form either. It is no longer installed by
default (in a normal configuration it'll just be compiled into the daemon).

libmissioncontrol (based on libtelepathy and also known as
libmissioncontrol-client) no longer exists, and has been replaced by
libmcclient (based on telepathy-glib).

Mission Control 5 is not a drop-in replacement for Mission Control 4, and
cannot be used by Mission-Control-4-based applications like Empathy 2.26
and the Maemo 4 platform. However, both versions can be installed
independently in the same directory prefix, to facilitate porting from one to
the other.

Known regressions since Mission Control 4:

* There is no gnome-keyring integration yet.
* The client and server library APIs are not considered to be stable yet.
