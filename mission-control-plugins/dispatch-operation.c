/**

 * @title: McpDispatchOperation
 * @short_description: Dispatch operation object, implemented by Mission Control
 * @see_also: #McpDispatchOperationPolicy
 * @include: mission-control-plugins/mission-control-plugins.h
 *
 * This object represents a Telepathy ChannelDispatchOperation object, as used
 * by Approvers. A ChannelDispatchOperation represents a bundle of one or more
 * Telepathy Channels being dispatched to user interfaces or other clients.
 *
 * The virtual method mcd_dispatch_operation_policy_check() receives an object
 * provided by Mission Control that implements this interface. It can be
 * used to inspect the channels, delay dispatching of the bundle until the
 * plugin is ready to continue, or close the channels in various ways.
 *
 * Only Mission Control should implement this interface.
