      <p>This interface extends the core Account interface to provide a
        user-settable avatar image.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>The avatar could have been a property on the core Account interface,
          but was moved to a separate interface because it is likely to be
          large. This means that clients can safely use GetAll to get
          properties on the core Account interface without flooding the
          session bus with large images.</p>

        The avatar to set on this account for display to other contacts,
        represented as a structure containing the bytes of the avatar,
        and the MIME type as a string; may be set to an empty byte-array and
        an empty string to indicate no avatar. When the account becomes
        connected, the account manager SHOULD set this avatar using SetAvatar
        if appropriate.

        <tp:rationale>The avatar itself is deliberately not included in this
          signal, to reduce bus traffic in the (likely common) case where no
          running application cares about the user's own avatar.</tp:rationale>
