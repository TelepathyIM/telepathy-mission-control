      <p>Some accounts can be used for multiple protocols; for instance, SIP
        and Skype accounts can often be used to contact the PSTN, MSN and
        Yahoo accounts can contact each other, and XMPP accounts can
        potentially contact many protocols via a transport.</p>
      <p>However, if the user does not intend to make use of this functionality,
        user interfaces can improve clarity by not displaying it: for instance,
        if a user prefers to call phone numbers via a particular SIP account,
        when an address book displays a contact with a phone number, it is
        desirable to display a "call with SIP" button for that account, but
        avoid displaying similar buttons for any other configured SIP or
        Skype accounts.</p>
      <p>The purpose of this interface is to allow this "for use with" information
        to be recorded and retrieved.</p>

        <p>A list of fields indicating the type of URI addressing scheme

          therefore not flagged as such in this field.</p>
