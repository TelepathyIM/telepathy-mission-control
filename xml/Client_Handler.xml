      <p>Handlers are the user interface for a channel. They turn an abstract
        Telepathy channel into something the user wants to see, like a text
        message stream or an audio and/or video call.</p>

      <p>For its entire lifetime, each channel on a connection known to the
        channel dispatcher is either being processed by the channel dispatcher,
        or being handled by precisely one Handler.</p>

      <p>Because each channel is only handled by one Handler, handlers may
        perform actions that only make sense to do once, such as acknowledging
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">Text</tp:dbus-ref>
        messages, doing the actual streaming for <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">StreamedMedia</tp:dbus-ref>
        channels with the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Interface">MediaSignalling</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface, or transferring the file in <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel.Type">FileTransfer</tp:dbus-ref>
        channels.</p>

      <p>When a new incoming channel (one with
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel">Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        = FALSE) is offered to
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client">Approver.DRAFT</tp:dbus-ref>s
        by the channel dispatcher, it also offers the Approvers a list of all
        the running or activatable handlers whose
        <tp:member-ref>HandlerChannelFilter</tp:member-ref> property
        (possibly as cached in the .client file) indicates that they
        are able to handle the channel. The Approvers can choose one of
        those channel handlers to handle the channel.</p>

      <p>When a new outgoing channel (one with
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel">Requested</tp:dbus-ref>
        = TRUE) appears, the channel dispatcher passes it to an appropriate
        channel handler automatically.

        <p>A specification of the channels that this channel handler can
          deal with. It will be offered to approvers as a potential
          channel handler for bundles that contain only suitable channels,
          or for suitable channels that must be handled separately.</p>

        <p>This property works in exactly the same way as the
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Client.Observer.DRAFT.ObserverChannelFilter</tp:dbus-ref>

          continues to own the corresponding Client bus name.</p>

        <p>In the .client file, it is represented in the
          same way as ObserverChannelFilter, but the group has the same

          handled, without invoking approvers.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The intended usage is to allow a client handling one channel to
            pick up closely related channels. Suppose a client capable of
            handling both Text and StreamedMedia,
            <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Empathy</code>, is
            handling a StreamedMedia channel. That client can take a second
            well-known bus name, say
            <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Client.Empathy._1._42.Bundle1</code>,
            and configure an object at
            <code>/org/freedesktop/Telepathy/Client/Empathy/_1/_42/Bundle1</code>
            with BypassApproval = TRUE,
            whose <tp:member-ref>HandlerChannelFilter</tp:member-ref>
            matches closely related Text channels by their Bundle property.

    <method name="HandleChannels" tp:name-for-bindings="Handle_Channels">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Called by the channel dispatcher when this client should handle these
          channels, or when this client should present channels that it is already
          handling to the user (e.g. bring them into the foreground).</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Clients are expected to know what channels they're already handling,
            and which channel object path corresponds to which window or tab.
            This can easily be done using a hash table keyed by channels' object
            paths.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>This method can raise any D-Bus error. If it does, the
          handler is assumed to have failed or crashed, and the channel
          dispatcher MUST recover in an implementation-specific way; it MAY
          attempt to dispatch the channels to another handler, or close the
          channels.</p>

        <p>If closing the channels, it is RECOMMENDED that the channel
          dispatcher attempts to close the channels using
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Channel.Close</tp:dbus-ref>,
          but resorts to calling
          <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Channel.Interface.Destroyable.Destroy</tp:dbus-ref>
          (if available) or ignoring the channel (if not) if the same handler
          repeatedly fails to handle channels.</p>

        <p>After HandleChannels returns successfully, the client process is
          considered to be responsible for the channel until it its unique
          name disappears from the bus.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>If a process has multiple Client bus names - some temporary and
            some long-lived - and drops one of the temporary bus names in order
            to reduce the set of channels that it will handle, any channels
            that it is already handling should remain unaffected.</p>

          <p>If the channel dispatcher is automatically replaced, the
            replacement can discover all Handlers by looking for the Client
            well-known bus names, and discover which channels they are
            currently handling. Once this has been done, all unhandled
            channels can be re-dispatched, and the only issue visible to
            the user is that unhandled channels that they have already
            approved might be sent back to Approvers.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>The value of this property SHOULD be the same for all Client
          instances that share a unique bus name, and SHOULD include all
          channels that are being handled, even if they were conceptually
          handled by a different Client instance.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>Otherwise, when a process released a temporary Client name,
            channels that it handled because of that Client name would no
            longer be state-recoverable.</p>
