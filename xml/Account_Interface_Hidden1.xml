    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>An interface for flagging certain accounts as hidden, so that they do
        not appear in the account manager's standard lists of accounts.
        Accounts whose <tp:member-ref>Hidden</tp:member-ref> property is
        <code>True</code> are intended for non-interactive use (by
        non-user-visible services), and appear on the <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace='imt1'>AccountManager.Interface.Hidden1</tp:dbus-ref>
        interface; in all other respects, they behave like any other
        account.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>XMPP, in particular, is increasingly used for purposes other than
          instant messaging and VoIP. For instance, extensions exist for
          inter-device bookmark synchronization.</p>

        <p>While obviously these services could re-use connections intended for
          instant messaging, in some cases you might want to use a different
          account. (Perhaps your bookmark sync provider is not your IM
          provider.) This API allows such auxiliary accounts to exist in
          Telepathy, while not being displayed in standard user interfaces for
          IM, VoIP, and friends.</p>

        <p>If <code>True</code>, this account is intended for non-interactive
          use, and thus should not be presented to the user. It will not appear
          in properties and signals on the main <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace='imt1'>AccountManager</tp:dbus-ref> interface; instead, it
          will show up on <tp:dbus-ref
