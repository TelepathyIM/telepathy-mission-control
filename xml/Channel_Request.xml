    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>A channel request is an object in the ChannelDispatcher representing
        an ongoing request for some channels to be created or found. There
        can be any number of ChannelRequest objects at the same time.</p>

      <p>Its well-known bus name is the same as that of the ChannelDispatcher,
        "org.freedesktop.Telepathy.ChannelDispatcher".</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>See
          <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">ChannelDispatcher.CreateChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
          for rationale for ChannelRequest being a separate object.</p>
      </tp:rationale>

      <p>A channel request can be cancelled by any client (not just the one
        that requested it). This means that the ChannelDispatcher will
        <tp:dbus-ref namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel">Close</tp:dbus-ref>
        the resulting channel, or refrain from requesting it at all, rather
        than dispatching it to a handler.</p>

        <p>The time at which user action occurred, or 0 if this channel
          request is for some reason not involving user action.</p>

          <a href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html">EWMH</a>.</p>

        <p>Proceed with the channel request.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The client that created this object calls this method
            when it has connected signal handlers for
            <tp:member-ref>Succeeded</tp:member-ref> and

        </tp:rationale>

        <p>Clients other than the client which created the ChannelRequest
          MUST NOT call this method.</p>

        <p>This method SHOULD return immediately; on success, the request
          might still fail, but this will be indicated asynchronously
          by the <tp:member-ref>Failed</tp:member-ref> signal.</p>

        <p>Proceed cannot fail, unless clients have got the life-cycle
          of a ChannelRequest seriously wrong (e.g. a client calls this
          method twice, or a client that did not create the ChannelRequest
          calls this method). If it fails, clients SHOULD assume that the
          whole ChannelRequest has become useless.</p>

          <tp:docstring>

            available. Stop calling it.

    </method>

    <method name="Cancel" tp:name-for-bindings="Cancel">
      <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
        <p>Cancel the channel request. The precise effect depends on the
          current progress of the request.</p>

        <p>If the connection manager has not already been asked to create
          a channel, then <tp:member-ref>Failed</tp:member-ref> is emitted
          immediately, and the channel request is removed.</p>

        <p>If the connection manager has already been asked to create a
          channel but has not produced one yet (e.g. if <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Connection.Interface.Requests.CreateChannel</tp:dbus-ref>
          has been called, but has not yet returned), then the
          ChannelDispatcher will remember that the request has been cancelled.
          When the channel appears, it will be closed (if it was newly
          created and can be closed), and will not be dispatched to a
          handler.</p>

        <p>If the connection manager has already returned a channel, but the
          channel has not yet been dispatched to a handler
          then the channel dispatcher will not dispatch that
          channel to a handler. If the channel was newly created for this
          request, the channel dispatcher will close it with <tp:dbus-ref
          namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Channel">Close</tp:dbus-ref>;
          otherwise, the channel dispatcher will ignore it. In either case,
          <tp:member-ref>Failed</tp:member-ref> will be emitted when processing
          has been completed.</p>

        <p>If <tp:member-ref>Failed</tp:member-ref> is emitted in response to
          this method, the error SHOULD be
          <code>org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Error.Cancelled</code>.</p>

        <p>If the channel has already been dispatched to a handler, then
          it's too late to call this method, and the channel request will
          no longer exist.</p>
