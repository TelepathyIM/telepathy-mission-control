      <p>Contact capabilities describe the channel classes which may be
        created with a given contact in advance of attempting to create a
        channel. Each capability represents a commitment by the
        connection manager that it will ordinarily be able to create a channel
        with a contact when given a request with the properties defined by the
        channel class.</p>

      <p>Capabilities pertain to particular contact handles, and represent
        activities such as having a text chat, a voice call with the user or a
        stream tube of a defined type.</p>

      <p>This interface also enables user interfaces to notify the connection
        manager what capabilities to advertise for the user to other contacts.
        This is done by using the
        <tp:member-ref>UpdateCapabilities</tp:member-ref> method.</p>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>XMPP is a major user of this interface: XMPP contacts will not,
          in general, be callable using VoIP unless they advertise suitable
          Jingle capabilities.</p>

        <p>Many other protocols also have some concept of capability flags,
          which this interface exposes in a protocol-independent way.</p>

        <p>Alter the connection's advertised capabilities to include
          the intersection of the given clients' capabilities with what the
          connection manager is able to implement.</p>

        <p>On connections managed by the ChannelDispatcher, processes other
          than the ChannelDispatcher SHOULD NOT call this method, and the
          ChannelDispatcher SHOULD use this method to advertise the
          capabilities of all the registered <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy">Client.Handler</tp:dbus-ref>
          implementations.On connections not managed by the ChannelDispatcher,
          clients MAY use this method directly, to indicate the channels they
          will handle and the extra capabilities they have.</p>

        <p>Upon a successful invocation of this method, the connection manager
          will only emit the
          <tp:member-ref>ContactCapabilitiesChanged</tp:member-ref> signal
          for the user's <tp:dbus-ref
            namespace="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Connection">SelfHandle</tp:dbus-ref>
          if, in the underlying protocol, the new capabilities are distinct
          from the previous state.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          <p>The connection manager will essentially intersect the provided
            capabilities and the channel classes it implements. Therefore,
            certain properties which are never fixed for a channel class
            (such as the target handle, or the Parameters property of a tube
            channel) will almost certainly not be advertised.</p>
        </tp:rationale>

        <p>This method MAY be called on a newly-created connection while it
          is still in the DISCONNECTED state, to request that when the
          connection connects, it will do so with the appropriate
          capabilities. Doing so MUST NOT fail.</p>

      <arg direction="in" name="Handler_Capabilities" type="a(saa{sv}as)"
        tp:type="Handler_Capabilities[]">
        <tp:docstring>
          <p>The capabilities of one or more clients.</p>

          <p>For each client in the given list, any capabilities previously
            advertised for the same client name are discarded, then replaced by
            the capabilities indicated.</p>

          <p>As a result, if a client becomes unavailable, this method SHOULD
            be called with a <tp:type>Handler_Capabilities</tp:type> structure
            containing its name, an empty list of channel classes, and an
            empty list of capabilities. When this is done, the connection
            manager SHOULD free all memory associated with that client name.</p>

          <tp:rationale>
            <p>This method takes a list of clients so that
              when the channel dispatcher first calls it (with a list of all
              the Handlers that are initially available), the changes can be
              made atomically, with only one transmission of updated
              capabilities to the network. Afterwards, the channel dispatcher
              will call this method with a single-element list every time
              a Handler becomes available or unavailable.</p>
          </tp:rationale>

          <p>The connection manager MUST ignore any channel classes and client
            capabilities for which there is no representation in the protocol
            or no support in the connection manager.</p>
