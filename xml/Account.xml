  <interface name="org.freedesktop.Telepathy.Account">
    <tp:docstring xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
      <p>An Account object encapsulates the necessary details to make a
        Telepathy connection.</p>

      <p>Accounts are uniquely identified by object path. The object path
        of an Account MUST take the form
        <code>/org/freedesktop/Telepathy/Account/<em>cm</em>/<em>proto</em>/<em>acct</em></code>, where:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><em>cm</em> is the same connection manager name that appears
          in the connection manager's well-known bus name and object path</li>
        <li><em>proto</em> is the protocol name as seen in
          ConnectionManager.ListProtocols, but with "-" replaced with "_"
          (i.e. the same as in the object-path of a Connection)</li>
        <li><em>acct</em> is an arbitrary string of ASCII letters, digits
          and underscores, starting with a letter or underscore, which
          uniquely identifies this account</li>
        <li>Clients SHOULD parse the object path to discover the
          connection manager and protocol</li>
        <li>Clients MUST NOT attempt to parse <em>acct</em></li>
        <li>Clients MUST NOT assume that <em>acct</em> matches
          the connection-specific part of a Connection's object-path and
          bus name</li>
        <li>The account manager SHOULD choose <em>acct</em> such that if
          an account is deleted, its object path will be re-used if and only
          if the new account is in some sense "the same"
          (incorporating the 'account' parameter in some way is
          recommended)</li>
      </ul>

      <tp:rationale>
        <p>This API avoids specifying the "profiles" used in Mission Control
          4.x or the "presets" that have been proposed to replace them. An
          optional interface will be provided for AM implementations
          that want to provide presets.</p>

        <p>There is deliberately no functionality here for opening channels;
          we intend to provide that in the channel dispatcher.</p>

        <p>Other missing features which would be better in their own
          interfaces:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>dynamic parameter-providing (aka provisioning)</li>
          <li>saved server capabilities</li>
          <li>account conditions</li>
          <li>account grouping</li>
        </ul>
      </tp:rationale>

    </tp:docstring>

    <!-- Missing functionality compared with NMC 4.x account + profile,
    apart from as listed above:

    * vCard field, + default profile for each vCard field
      (vCard field is per protocol and should be chosen by the
      Telepathy <-> address-book bridge?; default profile is now
      meaningless)

    * "normalized name" (normalized handle?)

    * branding icon (what's this and how does it differ from the icon?)

    * configuration UI (not our problem - perhaps the UI could special-case
      by cm,protocol,preset tuples?)

    * default account domain (somewhat meaningless in general; specialized
      account config UI can hard-code this)

    * SPLIT_ACCOUNT (pseudo-capability - this is a property of the protocol,
      not the profile, and in any case only the account config UI cares)

    Missing functionality compared with Decibel accounts:

    * we don't really know, they take arbitrary key/value pairs...
      but display name, protocol, presence/message, current, autoreconnect
      are the ones given special status by the source, and we have all of them
    -->

      <tp:docstring>
        This account has been removed.

        <tp:rationale>
          This is redundant with AccountRemoved, but it's still worth having,
          to avoid having to bind to AccountManager.AccountRemoved to tell
          you whether your Account is valid - ideally, an account-editing UI
          should only care about a single Account.
        </tp:rationale>
      </tp:docstring>
    </signal>

    <signal name="AccountPropertyChanged">
      <tp:docstring>
        The values of one or more properties on this interface (that do not
        specify that this signal does not apply to them) may have changed.
        This does not cover properties of other interfaces, which must
        provide their own change notification if appropriate.
      </tp:docstring>

      <arg name="Properties" type="a{sv}">
        <tp:docstring>
          A map from property names in this namespace (e.g. Nickname) to
          values. Properties whose values have not changed SHOULD be
          omitted, but this need not be done.
        </tp:docstring>
      </arg>
    </signal>

    <property name="DisplayName" type="s" access="readwrite">
      <tp:docstring>
        The user-visible name of this account. This SHOULD be chosen by the
        user at account creation time. The account creation user interface
        is responsible for setting a reasonable default value in the user's
        locale; something like "Jabber (bob@example.com)" would be sensible.

        <tp:rationale>
          This approximately corresponds to "display name" in NMC 4.x and
          Decibel.
        </tp:rationale>
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="Icon" type="s" access="readwrite">
      <tp:docstring>
        The name of an icon in the system's icon theme, such as "im-msn",
        or the empty string to not specify an icon. If the icon is set to
        an empty string, the account manager or any client MAY derive a
        default icon, for instance from the protocol.

        <tp:rationale>
          This approximately corresponds to mc_profile_get_icon_name
          (or possibly mc_profile_get_branding_icon_name) in NMC 4.x.
          It's accessed via the account rather than the profile because
          we no longer have profiles as a core concept.
        </tp:rationale>
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="Valid" type="b" access="read">
      <tp:docstring>
        If true, this account is considered by the account manager to be
        complete and usable. If false, user action is required to make it
        usable, and it will never attempt to connect (for instance, this
        might be caused by the absence of a required parameter).

        <tp:rationale>
          For connection managers with a plugin architecture, like
          telepathy-haze, we have little or no control over the parameters
          offered; for platforms with package management, we have little or
          no control over the CMs offered. NMC 4.x would just pretend the
          account didn't exist in these circumstances, but silent data loss
          is bad, and UIs with CM-specific knowledge (or a user filling in
          newly-required parameters) might be able to rescue a broken account.
        </tp:rationale>
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="Nickname" type="as" access="readwrite">
      <tp:docstring>
        The nickname to set on this account for display to other contacts,
        as set by the user. When the account becomes connected, the
        account manager SHOULD set this as the user's alias using SetAliases
        if appropriate.

        <tp:rationale>
          In a later specification revision, we plan to separate the concepts
          of a contact's nickname as set by themselves, and the local
          name for them in our contact list (a "handle" or "pet name" as
          described in XEP-0165 and its references). The terminology change
          from alias to nickname here is a step in that direction.
          This corresponds to NMC 4.x mc_account_get_alias.
        </tp:rationale>
      </tp:docstring>
    </property>

    <property name="Avatar" type="(ays)" access="readwrite">
      <tp:docstring>
        The avatar to set on this account for display to other contacts,
        represented as a structure containing the bytes of the avatar,
        and the MIME type as a string; may be set to an empty byte-array and
        an empty string to indicate no avatar. When the account becomes
        connected, the account manager SHOULD set this avatar using SetAvatar
        if appropriate.

        <tp:rationale>
          This corresponds to NMC 4.x mc_account_get_avatar.
        </tp:rationale>

    </property>

    <property name="Parameters" type="a{sv}" access="read">

        <p>A map from connection manager parameter names (as in the

          only those parameters that are stored for this account, and SHOULD
          only include those parameters that the user has explicitly set.
        </p>
        <p>This property cannot be altered using Set() - use
          UpdateParameters instead.</p>

        <tp:rationale>
          This avoids NMC being tied to gconf as a matter of API.

    <method name="UpdateParameters">

        reconnected.

        <tp:rationale>
          Migration tools that twiddle the settings of all accounts shouldn't
          cause an automatic disconnect and reconnect, probably. I could be
          persuaded otherwise, though. Or we could add a Reconnect() method.

        <p>The presence status that this account should have if it is brought

        <tp:rationale>
          In ITOS2007 and ITOS2008 this is a global preference, not visible
          on D-Bus (the "default presence"). "Automatic presence" better
          describes when it is used.

        online with the AutomaticPresence whenever possible (in the base
        Account interface this is deliberately left vague). If false,
        it MUST NOT put the account online automatically in response to,
        for instance, connectivity changes, but SHOULD still put the account
        online with the AutomaticPresence if requested by the user (for
        instance, if the user tries to start a conversation using this
        account).

        <tp:rationale>
          This approximately corresponds to NMC 4.x "enabled" and Decibel

        If the Connection property is non-empty, the status of that connection.
        If the Connection property is the empty string, this property may

        attempting to bring it online), or Connecting (indicating that the
        account manager is attempting to connect).
        The account manager is expected to set this by observing signals
        from the Connection.

        <tp:rationale>
          If the AM is doing some sort of backoff/delay on reconnection
          attempts, the account's status is conceptually "Connecting" even
          though there is no Connection. This vaguely corresponds to

        The account manager is expected to set this by observing signals

        <tp:rationale>
          If you weren't watching the Connection at the time it failed,
          you can't tell why - unless the AM can tell you. This is part

        The account manager is expected to set this by observing signals
