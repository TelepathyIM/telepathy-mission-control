telepathy-mission-control 5
===========================

Telepathy Mission Control 5 is an account manager and channel dispatcher for
the Telepathy framework, allowing user interfaces and other clients
to share connections to real-time communication services without conflicting.
It implements the AccountManager and ChannelDispatcher D-Bus APIs as described
by telepathy-spec.

The account manager part stores real time communication account details,
connects to the stored accounts on request, and sets the accounts' presence,
nickname and avatar according to requests from Telepathy user interfaces and
other components.

The channel dispatcher part responds to incoming communication channels
(message streams, voice/video calls, file transfers etc.) by dispatching
them to suitable user interfaces, and requests outgoing communication
channels according to requests from a Telepathy UI.

Telepathy is a D-Bus framework for unifying real time communication,
including instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. It abstracts
differences between protocols to provide a unified interface for
applications.

Mission Control currently also provides a C API. Please note that this API is
subject to rapid change (see below).

Requirements
============

Building Mission Control requires:
  GLib, GObject <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/glib/>
  libdbus <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus/>
  The D-Bus GLib bindings <http://dbus.freedesktop.org/releases/dbus-glib/>
  telepathy-glib <http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/releases/telepathy-glib/>

  GNU make <http://www.gnu.org/software/make/>
  pkg-config <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/pkg-config/>
  libxslt, xsltproc <http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/>
  Python <http://www.python.org/>

and can also make use of:
  gtkdoc <http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/gtk-doc/>

See configure.ac for full details, including versions required.
Of the packages listed above, only GLib, GObject, libdbus, dbus-glib and
telepathy-glib are required at runtime.

Building from git also requires the GNU build system (Autoconf, Automake,
libtool).

D-Bus API stability
===================

Interfaces described as stable in the Telepathy Specification
<http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/spec/> are considered stable and will not
generally have incompatible changes.

All other interfaces (including draft interfaces and Nokia-specific
extensions) are subject to change.

C API stability
===============

libmcclient is a client library for communicating with Mission Control. It
is not necessarily suitable for communication with any other Telepathy
AccountManager or ChannelDispatcher implementations, and will probably be
phased out eventually, in favour of library support in telepathy-glib.

libmissioncontrol-server contains most of the implementation of MC, and can
be used to produce a derivative of MC containing desktop- or device-specific
behaviour, like Maemo's proprietary osso-mission-control package. It is only
built and installed as a library if Mission Control is configured with
the --enable-plugins option; this is not recommended on mainstream Linux
distributions.

At this stage in development, neither library is considered stable; only
depend on them if you have control over the specific version of MC you're
using.

Versioning
==========

Starting from version 5.1.0, Mission Control follows the same Linux-style
odd/even minor versioning policy as most other Telepathy components: the 5.1.x
series are development releases, and 5.2.x will be the first stable branch.

Intermediate versions built from the git repository have a "+" suffix on the
version number, so version "5.1.0+" could be any snapshot taken between 5.1.0
and 5.1.1.

Contact info
============

Mission Control was originally written by Nokia Corporation for the Maemo
platform, but it is now maintained by the Telepathy project:

Hacking
=======

The current development version of MC is available from the
'master' branch in the git repository:
  <git://git.collabora.co.uk/git/telepathy-mission-control.git>
  <git+ssh://git.collabora.co.uk/git/telepathy-mission-control.git>
  <http://git.collabora.co.uk/?p=telepathy-mission-control.git> (gitweb)

Stable branches will be made available from branches with names like
'telepathy-mission-control-5.2' in the same repository.

Contributions for review should be attached to bugs in freedesktop.org
Bugzilla, with the "patch" tag. If there's no relevant bug, open one:
  <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Telepathy&component=telepathy-mission-control>

MC does not yet follow <http://telepathy.freedesktop.org/wiki/Style>. Please
follow the style used in the current code.
