.SH DESCRIPTION
Mission Control 5 implements the AccountManager and ChannelDispatcher services

to store account details, connect to accounts, request communication channels,
and have channels dispatched to them.

started automatically by D-Bus activation. However, it might be useful to
start it manually for debugging.
